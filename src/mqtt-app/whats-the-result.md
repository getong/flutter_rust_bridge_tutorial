# What's the result?

A flawed "bonus". Ah, yes, that sounds like a real challenge. I must admit, I haven't put much effort into this app. So, it's definitely only for the very brave.

So, here's the scoop: Picture thisâ€”a quirky little app riddled with more bugs than a cheap motel. Yep, I'm talking about the one I used to test out MQTT chat. You can catch all the action on YouTube (see above) if you're feeling adventurous.

Now, I did put together a tutorial chapter, trying to give at least some information and tips how to get it running on macOS and in the iOS Simulator simultaneously. But here's the kickerâ€”I couldn't crack the Android security issue regarding certificates. Sorry, Android fans, you're on your own with this one.

So, what's the verdict? Well, let's just say this app is tailor-made for the daredevils among us, the ones who thrive on a good challenge. If you've got a knack for troubleshooting and a touch of masochism, then by all means, dive right in. But for the rest of us mere mortals? Maybe stick to apps that don't require a crash course in programming just to send a message.

### Usage of the repository

Ah, now here's a hurdle: I'm not exactly a pro at downloading repositories and making them spring to life with just one magic install command. Nope, no hand-holding from me on this one. Proceed at your own risk, folks. You've been warned.
