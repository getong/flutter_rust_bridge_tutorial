# üßê How to get the most out of this tutorial

Chapter by chapter I will explain you the steps to connect Flutter and Rust to IOTA. I therefore recommend that you also read chapter by chapter and follow the steps.

Second, I advise you to set up a project from scratch. I know it can be tempting to just download the code from the repository and run it, but there's a good chance you'll run into problems.

Due to the different versions of Rust and Flutter you may have, it's safest to follow the step-by-step instructions and selectively include specific files in your own project.

Another reason is that not only will you learn more about the intricacies of setup, but you'll also be better equipped to troubleshoot any problems that arise.

I want you to be successful and not frustrated.

Finally, when you include the code snippets, feel free to try refactoring them if you don't like the coding style. Keep in mind that I'm not producing the cleanest, best code, I just want to get things working. Everything else is nice to have.
