## Let's write a User Story

As a user, I want to use an app to create a message and tag it, so that I can then send it to the tangle. I also want to be able to find my tag and message in the tangle in order to check if the data was sent correctly.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. The app should provide a user-friendly interface for creating and sending messages.
2. The app should allow me to enter the content of the message.
3. The app should have a field where I can add a tag to the message.
4. The app should have a button to send the message and the tag to the tangle.
5. Message and tag are sent as _Block with Tagged Data Payload_.
6. The app should store the tag, message and block id.
7. The app should provide a list of the sent tagged data blocks.
8. The app should allow to open the tangle explorer for a selected list item.

Note: It is assumed that the user is using the Shimmer Network.

## Describing the UI and Screen Flow
