## Kudos to the library developers

The library developers are doing an exceptional job, which I greatly appreciate and admire. Their dedication and expertise shine through in the creation of such remarkable libraries. The thought and effort they have put into crafting a robust and user-friendly tool is truly commendable. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and the invaluable contributions they have made to the development community. Kudos to the library developers for their outstanding efforts!

## From application developer's perspective

Ah, the mystical world of libraries and their captivating features! As an application developer, I yearn for the wisdom hidden within their depths. But lo and behold, it is not enough to wander through the labyrinth of documentation and tutorials, analyzing structures and classes. What I truly desire are the sacred scrolls of knowledge handed down by the library sages themselves — the library developers!

For who else possesses the arcane secrets of their creations? Only they hold the key to unlock the mysteries of design, capabilities, and best practices. With their insights and expertise, we can navigate the treacherous landscape of options and make informed choices.

There are examples, which are indeed quite helpful. Even if I apply them myself and try to understand them, it's still not easy to come up with my own use cases. It's like trying to tame a wild library beast — I lack the intuition to navigate its vast capabilities. The options are overwhelming, and the amount of knowledge I need feels like an insurmountable mountain. It's as if I'm standing at the entrance of a grand library, filled with books of endless possibilities, yet unsure of where to start.

### How can one easily develop a sense of familiarity with a library?

One possible solution might be that library developers provide a greater number of examples and, in addition, offering more comprehensive explanations about it to enhance our understanding of the subject matter.

I as app developer, I'm curious to know which functions are being used and why, how they are structured, and what options are maybe available. How are options implemented? Are there any alternative approaches worth considering? What are the peculiarities of these examples, and when would you recommend opting for an alternative solution? Thorough elucidation of these aspects by library developers would be immensely welcome and help me navigate the library's intricacies with confidence.
