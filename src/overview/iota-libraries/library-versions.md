# Library Versions

---

Helpful resource for identifying the appropriate dependency versions for your project.

---

When configuring dependencies, it's crucial to consider the compatibility between different libraries and their versions, as well as their support for specific target platforms.

While some third-party crates like OpenSSL and RustLS may have mutually exclusive usage, this isn't a concern with the IOTA libraries. Instead, the key focus lies in addressing the following two questions:

1. Which versions are designated for Stardust, the current protocol version of the Shimmer network, and which versions are intended for Chrysalis, the current protocol version of the IOTA mainnet?

2. Which versions can be successfully cross-compiled for the respective platform targets, including iOS, Android, and macOS?

## Stardust and Chrysalis Versions

The first question (see above) can be relatively straightforward to address.

To support the Shimmer network, the version of the iota-client being used should start with major version 2, such as 2.0.1.rc-7. _As a developer, you can verify this by checking the Cargo.lock file_. The Shimmer Network versions of iota-client can be found in the _develop_ branch of iota.rs

To support the IOTA Mainnet, it is recommended to use version 1.4.0 of the iota-client library (as of June 2023). You can verify this by checking if there is a newer major version 1 available on crates.io or by referring to the GitHub repository. The IOTA Mainnet versions of iota-client can be found in the _production_ branch of iota.rs.

> TIP-0013 is labeled as _Chrysalis_, and it is associated with the REST API, which includes API calls using `api/v1`. These requests are utilized in version 1.4.0.
>
> TIP-0025 is labeled as _Stardust_, and it is associated with the Core REST API that involves API calls using `api/v2`. These requests are utilized in versions 2.x.y.

## Versions used for "full-featured" app

The second question (see above) is more complex. It primarily revolves around determining which third-party libraries are used by the IOTA libraries and what dependencies are employed by those libraries, and so on.

Because each additional library increases the risk that it may not be cross-compiled for a specific target platform (iOS, Android, etc.). I specifically want to mention the two libraries, _libsodium_ and _rocksdb_, at this point. Unfortunately, there are often issues when compiling for different targets with these libraries.

Here is a matrix illustrating the library versions utilized in a "full-featured" Shimmer app. The objective is to employ iota-client, iota-wallet, and identity_iota simultaneously, along with the stronghold feature.

** NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED ! Status as of Jan 2023**

You need to include different dependencies for the crate iota-wallet. This is due to an unsolved issue with regard to the third-party library of rocksdb.

**TODO: Versions to be reviewed in milestone 3**

**TODO: Explain rocksdb issue in more detail in milestone 3 IF STILL EXISTS - [rocksdb 0.20.1 was included into iota-wallet on 13th of Feb 2023](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/commit/970f6df22ee88c1ae7e5595ba4e9815998077f01)**
