# Alternatives

"The world keeps turning. Are there alternatives to the Flutter Rust Bridge?"

---

A user has pointed out to me that there's another project connecting the realms of Flutter as a GUI and Rust as a backend.

## Rinf: Rust in Flutter

In essence, the goal is to have a way to make requests from Flutter to the Rust backend. This is precisely what Rinf accomplishes. It resembles more of an API that allows you to make RustRequests associated with a specific operation from Flutter. In return, the call yields RustResponses as the response.

What matters most is the workflow. If another tool proves to offer a simpler and/or less error-prone workflow, it's worth exploring and evaluating. At the moment, I cannot personally assess whether this applies to Rinf. Therefore, I'm just highlighting this alternative and leave it to you, the developers, to try it out and make your own judgment.

In this tutorial, I consistently use the Flutter Rust Bridge. At this point (December 2023), it doesn't make sense for me to introduce another tool as the intermediary between Flutter and Rust.

Feel free to share your experiences with me on Twitter (@dj_kaiota). I'd love to hear about it!
