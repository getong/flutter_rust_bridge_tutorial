Exploring the possibilities and limitations of integrating Dart and Rust.

---

The user guide devotes a large portion of Rust code vs. Dart code comparisons to highlight the possibilities and limitations of using the Flutter Rust Bridge. It is highly recommended to consult the user guide when starting to write your own code in `api.rs`:

In addition to these chapters in the user guide, the _frb example_ folder in the GitHub repository serves as a valuable resource. It contains two files: one with Dart code with numerous examples, and another with corresponding Rust code demonstrating the same examples. This resource provides practical illustrations of how integration between Rust and Dart can be implemented and provides insight and inspiration for your own development projects.
