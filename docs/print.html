<p>A Tutorial to build modern apps using IOTA, the next generation Distributed Ledger Technology</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="hey-there"><a class="header" href="#hey-there">Hey there!!</a></h2>
<p>Ready to add some sparkle to your app development? Stay here, where we not only support the IOTA Mainnet but also the Shimmer Network! With this flexible approach, developers can easily choose whether to integrate the Chrysalis or the Stardust version into their projects (and let's be honest, who doesn't love a little shimmer in their code)? So why wait? Say hello to Flutter and Rust and join me on this exciting journey and let us make your apps shine!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, the presented workflow supports both the <em>Shimmer Network</em> (protocol version &quot;Stardust&quot;) and the <em>IOTA Mainnet</em> (protocol version &quot;Chrysalis&quot;). It depends on which library versions you as developer include in your project.</p>
<p>I assume developers are more interested in adopting the Stardust version, so I use the Shimmer (Testnet) and related libraries in my examples. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p>Originally I was searching for a workflow to build real-world products in the form of mobile and desktop applications backed by the Distributed Ledger Technology of IOTA. My goal was and is to facilitate the adoption of IOTA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just to clarify, every time I mention <em>IOTA</em>, I'm also referring to <em>Shimmer</em>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to create a flexible solution that would allow developers to use a reduced technology stack for their projects. With <em>IOTA for Flutter</em>, I believe we've achieved that goal, and I'm excited to share it with the world. And believe me: Coming from Java and JavaScript frameworks I was not at all familiar with Flutter and Rust in the beginning.</p>
<p>I remember those days - the endless hours of debugging, the frustration of hitting the same roadblocks over and over again. But after four long months of trial and error, I finally found the solution with <em>IOTA for Flutter</em>. </p>
<p>This documentation is a condensed tutorial that summarizes everything I learned during that grueling proof-of-concept process. And now, I want to share that knowledge with you. Think of my tutorial as your personal guide to app development for IOTA - a way to save you time and headaches, so you can focus on what really matters.</p>
<p>Now, before you get too excited, I should warn you that app development is still app development, and there's always a chance that things might not work out the way you planned. Trust me, I've been there. But hey, that's half the fun, right? The thrill of the chase, the excitement of finally figuring out that pesky bug - it's all part of the process. Just don't blame me if you find yourself cursing my name at three in the morning when something doesn't work quite right. But hey, if it was easy, everyone would be doing it, right? So let's roll up our sleeves and get to work!</p>
<p><em>IOTA for Flutter</em> is a sponsored project by the Tangle Community Treasury. The funding allows me to organize my collected notes and prepare them for you. At this point, a big thank you to everyone involved!</p>
<h2 id="you-know-flutter-but-not-iota"><a class="header" href="#you-know-flutter-but-not-iota">You know Flutter but not IOTA?</a></h2>
<p>By exploring IOTA, a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), you can expand your knowledge and explore the exciting possibilities of new use cases beyond the limitations of Web 2.0. This technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries, such as supply chain management, smart city infrastructure, and digital identity verification.</p>
<p>IOTA is unique in that it is a permissionless, decentralized system designed to enable secure and feeless exchange of value and data transfer between connected actors. Unlike traditional blockchain-based systems, IOTA does not rely on miners to validate transactions. Instead, each transaction verifies two previous transactions, creating a web-like network of transactions called the <em>Tangle</em>. This makes IOTA's DLT highly scalable and able to handle large amounts of transactions with zero fees.</p>
<p>Of course, it's a good idea to take a look at the official websites for IOTA and Shimmer (which is the staging network of IOTA), see below. There, you'll find plenty of resources and information to help you get up some more information about it and what it is used for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're a Flutter developer who's not familiar with IOTA or Shimmer, don't worry!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no substitute for hands-on experience, and that's where <em>IOTA for Flutter</em> comes in. While the official websites for IOTA and Shimmer provide a great starting point, the best way to truly understand how to use these technologies in your Flutter projects is to give it a try yourself. </p>
<p><em>IOTA for Flutter</em> provides a tutorial-style documentation that walks you through the process of integrating IOTA and Shimmer step-by-step. So don't be afraid to jump in and give it a shot! Who knows, you might just surprise yourself with what you can accomplish.</p>

<h2 id="seamless-user-interfaces-for-human-interaction"><a class="header" href="#seamless-user-interfaces-for-human-interaction">Seamless User Interfaces for human interaction</a></h2>
<figure style="margin:0;"><img src="welcome/../assets/actors.png" alt=""><figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em;text-align:center;"><p>This tutorial is about building User Interfaces for human interaction (highlighted in red)</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The focus of this project is to provide a user interface or interaction capability with IOTA for humans. While IOT devices, machines or smart contracts can also interact with IOTA, the primary goal here is to create a seamless experience for people to connect and engage with IOTA's Layer 1 network.</p>
<p>The main goal is achieved by building mobile and desktop apps. The focus is on the target platforms that Flutter supports, with the caveat that the proof-of-concept has only been tested on iOS, Android, and macOS. </p>
<p>Rust plays a crucial role in <em>IOTA for Flutter</em>, too. All of IOTA's libraries are written in Rust and are referred to as the <strong>Single Source of Truth</strong>. I will explain how these Rust libraries are used as a dependency in a custom library which is cross-compiled and integrated into Flutter.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial-structure-overview-fundamentals-and-practical-chapters"><a class="header" href="#tutorial-structure-overview-fundamentals-and-practical-chapters">Tutorial Structure: Overview, Fundamentals, and Practical Chapters</a></h2>
<p>The <em>IOTA for Flutter</em> tutorial is divided into several sections, including a fundamentals section for preparing what you need, an overview for getting the key concept, and several practical chapters that focus on building real-world products. </p>
<p>To make it easier to follow along with the written text, each practical chapter has a corresponding repository on GitHub. I also provide some videos to demonstrate the resulting app, the workflow and guide users through important steps, so you can watch over my shoulder as I work through the examples. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Three Pillars of the Tutorial</strong>: Github Page, Repositories and Videos</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The practical chapters are structured as follows: first, we start with an introductory chapter to build an app with Flutter and Rust without IOTA. This will introduce the Flutter-Rust-Bridge, the glueing part that brings Flutter and Rust together. Then, we dive into building a simple IOTA-powered app, followed by a comprehensive &quot;Shimmer playground&quot; app to demonstrate all Rust libraries in one app. </p>
<p>As a bonus, I provide the code for the MQTT Chat App. In this chapter, I assume that you have gained enough knowledge and experience from the previous practical chapters.</p>

<hr />
<p>Flutter vs. JS Frameworks</p>
<hr />
<p>Hold on to your keyboards because it's time for a chapter that will be more exciting than a cat chasing a laser pointer. We're about to explore how familiar Flutter looks when you compare it to JavaScript frameworks and what other reasons there are top use it - and let me tell you, it's going to be so much fun you might want to put on a party hat.</p>
<p>Well, I know some of you might be thinking, ‚ÄúWait a minute, I'm a JavaScript developer, why should I care about Flutter?‚Äù Well, let me ask you, have you ever heard the phrase ‚ÄúDiversity is the spice of life &quot; heard? Yes, that also applies here. By expanding your skills and learning more about Flutter, you might discover a whole new world of possibilities and solutions to your coding challenges.</p>
<p>So get ready to rock and roll, code warriors, because it's time to expand your programming horizons and discover why Flutter should play a part in your life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I first started learning Flutter, I had zero prior knowledge. To give myself a boost of motivation, I turned to videos to get a better understanding of what Flutter is all about. Watching videos not only helped me to get started with Flutter, but also gave me the confidence to continue learning and building my own apps.</p>

<p>Flutter is like a treasure trove of creative possibilities, just waiting for you to unlock its secrets. With Flutter, you can build stunning user interfaces, craft intricate animations and interactions, and even dip your toes into the wild and wacky world of game development. You'll discover lots of sources of inspiration that will leave you buzzing with excitement. </p>
<p>Later on, you will realize how interacting with Rust libraries empowers you to develop potent products - precisely what you are aiming for.</p>
<h2 id="everything-as-code"><a class="header" href="#everything-as-code">Everything as code!?</a></h2>
<p>In Flutter, a component is a self-contained, reusable piece of a user interface. It is a widget that can be used in a Flutter app to create a specific visual and/or interactive element, such as a button, text field, or image. A component in Flutter can be composed of other components, making it possible to create complex UIs by assembling smaller, reusable parts.</p>
<p>Doesn't that sound familiar to you!? </p>
<p>Let's compare a single Flutter widget with a Vue.js component. In Flutter you write the whole component as Dart code:</p>
<pre><code>import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyButton extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        print('Button clicked');
      },
      child: Text(
        'Klick mich!',
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
      ),
      style: ButtonStyle(
        backgroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.all&lt;Color&gt;(Colors.green),

<p>Flutter's approach of writing everything as code provides a more streamlined and cohesive development experience compared to the traditional separation of HTML, CSS, and JS. With Flutter, you can create custom user interfaces and animations with greater ease and control, and the resulting apps are faster and smaller. Plus, no more switching between different languages and files like a mad scientist!</p>
<p>A very important difference to JavaScript Frameworks is: Flutter compiles the Dart code to native machine code. Theoretically you have the control over every pixel on the screen. BTW, this also differs from React Native where written code is compiled only to the native UI components.</p>

<hr />
<p>Just a few examples to show you'll feel familiar - but you'll also have to learn new rules</p>
<hr />
<p>Below, you'll find a completely incomplete list ü§™, but it is intended to show that there are many similarities between Dart and JavaScript, making it easier to switch between the two languages or even learn both simultaneously. There are other rules too, but you can easily learn them.</p>
<p>Some more comprehensive information you can find in the official docs. Here are two links:</p>

<h3 id="variable-declaration"><a class="header" href="#variable-declaration">Variable declaration</a></h3>
<p>Like in JavaScript, in Dart <code>var</code> is short for variable. It is used to declare a variable whose type is <em>statically inferred</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-dart">var mystr = &quot;shimmer&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we declare a variable of type <code>String</code>. One of the convenient features of Dart is that it's able to infer the type of a variable based on the value that's assigned to it. Here, it's quite evident that it's a String type.</p>
<p>But unlike JavaScript, you CANNOT change the type of the variable afterwards!</p>
<pre><code class="language-dart">var mystr = &quot;shimmer&quot;;
mystr = 10; // THIS ASSIGNMENT DOESN'T WORK!
</code></pre>
<p>When we attempt to change the type of a variable in Dart, the compiler will generate an error. This is because Dart is a statically typed language, which means that the data type of a variable is determined at compile-time and cannot be changed during runtime.</p>
<p>Another way to declare variables is the explicit type declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-dart">String mystr = &quot;shimmer&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>In Dart, it's generally considered good practice to explicitly declare the data type of a property when defining a class. This helps to ensure that the code is more easily understood and maintainable, especially when working on larger projects with multiple developers.</p>
<p>For variables within smaller scopes, such as a method, the &quot;var&quot; keyword can be used instead of explicitly declaring the data type. This is because the scope is smaller and it's often easier to infer the type of the variable based on the context of the code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-dart">class MyCat {
   String cat = &quot;Bob&quot;;

   void someMethod() {
     var anotherVariable = &quot;Tom&quot;;
   }
}

<hr />
<h2 id="lots-of-free-gb"><a class="header" href="#lots-of-free-gb">Lots of free GB</a></h2>
<p>XCode, Android Studio, the SDKs and Virtual Devices, all that stuff needs GBs on your disc. Welcome to app development! Additionally it turns out that the cross-compiling process to build the libraries takes an enormous amount of disk space PER target, too.</p>
<h3 id="xcode"><a class="header" href="#xcode">XCode</a></h3>
<p>As you continue to use Xcode, the available storage on your hard drive gradually decreases. This is because numerous files are generated automatically during project builds, with a significant amount of them being stored in the Derived Data folder. This folder alone can occupy anywhere from a few hundred MB to several GB of space.</p>
<figure style="margin:0;"><img src="welcome/../assets/derived_data.jpg" alt=""><figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em;text-align:center;"><p>Disc space used by derived data</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fortunately, you can easily remove files from this folder without any adverse effects. By doing so, you can recover valuable space on your Mac, making it more efficient to work with Xcode.</p>
<h3 id="building-apps"><a class="header" href="#building-apps">Building apps</a></h3>
<p>If you build more apps and cross-compile more targets, the disk space usage increases. However, you can safely remove these subfolders. The only difference it makes is in terms of time - the first build will take longer if the target folder has been deleted.</p>

<p>Recommendations for a successful integration</p>
<hr />
<p>Chapter by chapter I will explain you the steps to connect Flutter and Rust to IOTA. I therefore recommend that you also read section by section and follow the steps.</p>
<p>Second, I advise you to set up a project from scratch. I know it can be tempting to just download the code from the repository and run it, but there's a good chance you'll run into problems.</p>
<p>Due to the different versions of Rust and Flutter you may have, it's safest to follow the step-by-step instructions and selectively include specific files in your own project.</p>
<p>Another reason is that not only will you learn more about the intricacies of setup, but you'll also be better equipped to troubleshoot any problems that arise.</p>
<p>I want you to be successful and not frustrated.</p>
<p>Finally, when you include the code snippets, feel free to try refactoring them if you don't like the coding style. Keep in mind that I'm not producing the cleanest, best code, I just want to get things working. Everything else is nice to have.</p>

<hr />
<p>Welcome to the section where we clear up any misunderstandings before you dive in! Think of it as the disclaimer before the main event, like when they tell you not to try the stunts you see in action movies at home.</p>
<p>So, what can you expect from this tutorial? We'll cover how to connect Flutter and Rust to IOTA, but let's make it crystal clear what's not on the menu. </p>
<p>First, we won't go into detailed explanations of IOTA - we'll leave the philosophical musings to the experts.</p>
<p>Also, this tutorial assumes you've already got Xcode, Android Studio, Flutter, and Rust up and running, so we won't bore you with deep installation instructions. Yes, there are sections called &quot;Set up&quot;, but please understand that I can't deeply dive in but only can give you the right links and useful hints.</p>
<p>And sorry, no teaching of Dart or Rust - I'll assume that it's on your bucket list and you know what you're doing!</p>
<p>Finally, I won't be exploring the proof-of-concept for Linux, Windows, browsers, or browser extensions - this ain't no Cirque du Soleil show. I am using a Mac and so my personal means are limited.</p>
<p>And don't expect any deployment or production readiness insights - we'll let you handle the red carpet rollout yourself.</p>

<p>Xcode: Where Complexity Unfolds, Humor Helps Break the Mold.</p>
<hr />
<p>At first glance, Xcode resembles an airplane cockpit: Overwhelming and seemingly impossible to navigate. But here's the thing: You don't need to fiddle with most of the settings.</p>
<p>Flutter has taken care of generating the Xcode project for you. As for the second Xcode project for the Rust library (mentioned below), that's created by cargo-xcode.</p>
<p>So, don't worry! All you need to do is grasp a few essential concepts and locate some helpful resources to find your way around. And hey, who knows, maybe you'll even learn to enjoy the Xcode experience, despite its initial complexity!</p>
<h2 id="project-structure"><a class="header" href="#project-structure">Project structure</a></h2>
<p>A Xcode project follows a specific structure that organizes the various files and resources used to build an macOS or iOS application.</p>
<p><strong>Project File</strong>: A project file with the extension <em>.xcodeproj</em> or <em>.xcworkspace</em> serves as the entry point for the Xcode project. It contains information about the project settings, build configurations, and references to all the project files.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><em>.xcodeproj</em></strong> file is the traditional project file used in Xcode. It represents a single Xcode project and is used for organizing and building a single target, such as an iOS app, extension, or framework. It contains project settings, build configurations, and references to all the project files specific to that target.</li>
<li>The <strong><em>.xcworkspace</em></strong> file, on the other hand, is used when you have multiple Xcode projects or multiple targets that depend on each other. It is a workspace file that can include one or more <em>.xcodeproj</em> files and their associated targets. The <em>.xcworkspace</em> file acts as a container that allows you to work on and build multiple projects or targets together in a unified workspace.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Targets</strong>: An Xcode project can have one or more targets. Each target represents a distinct product, such as the main app, extensions, or test suites. Targets contain the necessary build settings, dependencies, and references to source files.</p>
<p><strong>Source Code</strong>: The source code files are organized within groups or folders. The default group is typically named after the project and contains the main application's source code files. Additional groups can be created to organize code files into logical categories or features.</p>
<p><strong>Frameworks and Libraries</strong>: Xcode projects often use external frameworks and libraries to extend functionality or reuse code. These dependencies are managed within the project and are listed in the &quot;Frameworks and Libraries&quot; section. They can be system frameworks, third-party libraries, or custom frameworks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Flutter/Rust context, the Rust Code is a separate Xcode Project which is included as &quot;subproject&quot; into the main project. This Xcode Project is created by the tool <em>cargo-xcode</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Configuration Files</strong>: Configuration files, such as <code>Info.plist</code>, contain essential metadata about the application, including its bundle identifier, version, required device capabilities, and permissions.</p>
<p><strong>Build Settings</strong>: Xcode provides an interface to configure build settings for the project and individual targets. These settings control compiler flags, optimization settings, code signing, deployment targets, and various other project-specific configurations.</p>

</a>
</figure>
<p>The interaction of this structure, composed of multiple Xcode projects, becomes more apparent when we build applications for macOS resp. iOS in the practical chapters.</p>
<p>At this stage, it's worth mentioning that there exists a dedicated Rust Xcode project <em>rust.xcodeproj</em>. This project is created during an initialization step of the <em>Flutter Rust Bridge</em> for macOS or iOS. It includes a script (&quot;Build Rule&quot;) that serves the purpose of generating a static or dynamic library and integrating it into the build process of the main Xcode project <em>Runner.xcodeproj</em> for the app.</p>
<h3 id="-1"><a class="header" href="#-1"></a></h3>
<h2 id="static-and-dynamic-libraries"><a class="header" href="#static-and-dynamic-libraries">Static and dynamic libraries</a></h2>
<p>Static and dynamic libraries are both forms of code libraries, but they differ in how they are linked and loaded into an application.</p>
<p><strong>Static Libraries</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A static library, also known as a static link library, is a compiled set of object code that is <strong>linked directly into an executable at the time of compilation</strong>. The library code becomes part of the final executable binary.</li>
<li>When an application is built with a static library, <strong>all the library code is copied into the resulting binary</strong>. This means that the application becomes self-contained and doesn't rely on the presence of the library during runtime.</li>
<li><strong>Static libraries are typically denoted by file extensions like .a (on macOS and iOS) or .lib (on Windows)</strong>. They provide a way to distribute pre-compiled code that can be linked with multiple applications without needing to distribute the library separately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dynamic Libraries</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dynamic library, also called a shared library or dynamic link library (DLL), is a separate binary file containing compiled code that <strong>can be loaded and linked by multiple applications at runtime</strong>.</li>
<li>Unlike static libraries, dynamic libraries <strong>are not copied into the application binary</strong>. Instead, the application references the dynamic library and loads it dynamically during runtime.</li>
<li>Dynamic libraries offer advantages such as code sharing among multiple applications and the ability to update the library independently without recompiling the applications that depend on it.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic libraries are usually denoted by file extensions like .dylib (on macOS and iOS) or .dll (on Windows)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Flutter, developed by Google, aims to provide developers with a unified codebase to build cross-platform applications that can be deployed on various targets. Originally designed to support mobile devices, Flutter has expanded its reach to include desktop platforms such as macOS, Windows, and Linux, as well as browser applications.</p>

</figure>
<p>At its core, Flutter consists of two main components: the UI Framework and a Collection of Tools. The UI Framework encompasses a rich set of code packages that empower developers to create visually appealing user interfaces. The collection of tools, on the other hand, enables the transformation of a single codebase into machine code capable of running on diverse platforms.</p>

</figure>
<p>Flutter uses Dart as programming language. It's important to note that while you can write Dart code for all platforms using Flutter, there are specific requirements for building and testing applications on different targets. Building apps for iOS/macOS necessitates a macOS computer with XCode installed, while building and running Windows apps requires a Windows machine, and the same goes for Linux. However, developing Android and browser apps can be done on any host machine, as Android Studio is compatible with multiple operating systems.</p>

<p>Avoid Special Characters and Blanks in your installation path!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When installing Flutter, it's important to note the differences between Mac and Windows systems. One of the system requirements is having Git installed, as Flutter utilizes it for installation and updates. On Windows, Git needs to be installed separately. However, on Mac, Git is conveniently included in Xcode. For a smooth installation experience, it is recommended to install Xcode before Flutter on Mac systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mac Users</strong></p>
<p>Even if you already have Xcode installed, go through the installation guide and check each step! For example, don't forget to add the Xcode Command-line tools.</p>
<p>Side notes</p>
<ul>
<li>To find out which shell you are using: <code>echo $SHELL</code></li>
<li>To toggle hidden directories and files: <code>command + shift + .</code></li>

<hr />
<h2 id="project-structure-1"><a class="header" href="#project-structure-1">Project structure</a></h2>
<p>A typical Flutter project follows a specific structure that organizes the various components and resources of the application. Here is a description of the common project structure in a Flutter project:</p>
<p><strong>android</strong>: This directory contains the Android-specific files and configurations for the Flutter project. It includes the Android manifest file, Gradle build scripts, and other resources specific to the Android platform.</p>
<p><strong>ios</strong>: This directory holds the iOS-specific files and configurations. It includes the Xcode project, property list files, and other resources specific to iOS development.</p>
<p><strong>lib</strong>: The lib directory is where the main Dart code for the Flutter application resides. It contains the main.dart file, which serves as the entry point for the application. Additionally, you can organize your code into multiple files or directories within the lib directory to improve code modularity and maintainability.</p>
<p><strong>macos</strong>: This directory holds the macOS-specific files and configurations. It includes the Xcode project, property list files, and other resources specific to macOS development.</p>
<p><strong>test</strong>: The test directory is used for writing unit tests and integration tests for your Flutter application. It typically contains test files and directories to organize your test code.</p>
<p><strong>assets</strong>: The assets directory is where you can store static files such as images, fonts, and other resources required by your application. These files can be accessed using Flutter's asset management system.</p>
<p><strong>pubspec.yaml</strong>: The pubspec.yaml file is a YAML-formatted configuration file that defines the project's metadata, dependencies, and assets. It specifies the required packages, version constraints, and additional resources like fonts or images.</p>

<p>When installing Rust, the recommended approach is to use <strong>rustup</strong>, a versatile tool that serves as both an installer and version manager for Rust.</p>
<p>With rustup, you gain access to a comprehensive toolset that enhances your Rust development experience. It includes <strong>rustc</strong>, the rust compiler responsible for translating your Rust code into executable binaries or libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Cargo</strong>, another essential component, is the Rust package manager. It also simplifies dependency management, project building, testing, and more, serving as a valuable asset in your Rust workflow.</p>
<p>rustup also offers rustfmt and clippy. rustfmt is a source code formatter that ensures consistent and elegant formatting in your Rust codebase. On the other hand, clippy is a Rust linter that helps identify potential issues and provides helpful suggestions to improve your code.</p>
<p>So, everything starts with installing rustup.</p>
<p>On macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS, to download rustup and install Rust, run the following in your terminal, then follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p><code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh</code></p>
<h3 id="was-the-installation-successful"><a class="header" href="#was-the-installation-successful">Was the installation successful?</a></h3>
<p>Open a <em>new</em> shell and type the following:</p>
<p><code>rustc --version</code></p>
<p>If there is a meaningful output displaying <code>rustc &lt;version&gt;</code> then the installation was successful.</p>
<h2 id="updating-rust"><a class="header" href="#updating-rust">Updating Rust</a></h2>
<p>Rust updates very frequently. If you have installed Rustup some time ago, chances are your Rust version is out of date. Get the latest version of Rust by running:</p>
<p><code>rustup update</code></p>

<hr />
<h2 id="project-structure-2"><a class="header" href="#project-structure-2">Project structure</a></h2>
<p>A Rust Library Project includes the following elements:</p>
<p><strong>src</strong>: This directory serves as the main location for the library's source code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>lib.rs</strong>: The <code>lib.rs</code> file acts as the entry point. It acts as a central module where you can declare and organize the public items (functions, structs, enums, traits, etc.) that are intended to be accessible to other crates (projects) that depend on the library. These items are marked with the pub visibility keyword to make them visible outside of the library's crate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional source code files and subdirectories can be organized within the src directory to maintain a modular and organized codebase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the context of Flutter, Rust and the Flutter Rust Bridge, we organize the structure in the following way: The public functions and structs that are intended to be exposed in the API are code in the file <code>api.rs</code>. This file is then integrated as module into the <code>lib.rs</code> file.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>target</strong>: This directory serves as the build location for the library. It will be automatically created once the <code>cargo build</code> command is used. In this directory, your storage space vanishes into thin air like a magical bunny in a hat! You can remove it whenever you like - but: Deleting comes at the expense of time. During the first build, all necessary resources are loaded, which takes time. If the directory exists, all subsequent builds are faster.</p>
<p><strong>Cargo.toml</strong>: The Cargo.toml file acts as the manifest for the library project, defining metadata such as the package name, version, dependencies, and build configurations.</p>
<p><strong>Cargo.lock</strong>: This file is an automatically generated file. When you build a Rust project using Cargo, it resolves the dependencies specified in the <em>Cargo.toml</em> manifest file and generates the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file. This file includes the specific versions of each dependency and their transitive dependencies that were resolved during the build process.</p>

<p>A <em>Crate</em> refers to a package or a module of code. Crates act as a unit of code organization and encapsulation, providing a way to manage and share code functionality.</p>
<p>Crates can also have dependencies on other crates, allowing them to utilize external code and libraries. The dependencies are declared in the Cargo.toml file of the crate, under the [dependencies] section.</p>

<p>Rustup is a version manager that allows you to easily install, manage, and switch between different toolchains.</p>
<p>A toolchain refers to a specific version of the Rust compiler and associated tools that are used to compile, build, and manage projects. It includes the Rust compiler itself, the standard library, and other essential components required for Rust development.</p>
<p>Having multiple toolchains allows developers to work with different Rust language features, test compatibility across versions, and ensure their code works as intended in different Rust environments.</p>
<p>The Terminal command</p>
<p><code>rustup show</code></p>
<p>provides an overview of the Rust installation details, such as the installed toolchains, the currently active toolchain, and the associated components like cross-compiling targets.</p>

<p>The Big Picture</p>
<hr />
<p>In this next section, I'll provide an overview of the workflow involved in integrating Flutter, Rust, and IOTA. This will give you a better understanding of what a developer needs to do in order to successfully connect these technologies and create an app using the Flutter-Rust-Bridge.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-workflow"><a class="header" href="#understanding-the-workflow">Understanding the Workflow</a></h2>
<p>Take a simple example: An app with just a button and a text field. When the user clicks the button, it should establish a connection to a Shimmer node and retrieve information about it. This information will then be displayed in the text field.</p>
<figure style="margin:0;"><img src="overview/how-everything-works-together/../../assets/overview/Overview.001.png" alt="Example 1"><figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em;text-align:center;"><p>Example: User gets node info on button click</p></figcaption></figure>
<h3 id="app-processes"><a class="header" href="#app-processes">App Processes</a></h3>
<p>Within the application itself, the following occurs: in the frontend, when the button is clicked, it triggers its handler. This handler utilizes a method provided by the Foreign Function Interface (FFI). FFI is a mechanism that enables programming languages to call functions from libraries written in a different language. In the context of Flutter and Rust, FFI facilitates communication between the Flutter frontend and the Rust backend. Essentially, the button handler invokes a Rust method. This method then forwards the request to a function in the IOTA Rust library, which retrieves the desired information from the node. The information is then relayed back using the same pathway.</p>
<figure style="margin:0;"><img src="overview/how-everything-works-together/../../assets/overview/Overview.002.png" alt="Sequence Diagram"><figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em;text-align:center;"><p>Sequence Diagram</p></figcaption></figure>
<h3 id="various-stages"><a class="header" href="#various-stages">Various Stages</a></h3>
<p>During the <strong>Development Phase</strong> (see above), this means that the UI and handlers are written in the Dart programming language, while the backend functions are implemented in Rust. This separation allows for leveraging the strengths of both languages: Dart for the frontend user interface and interactivity, and Rust for robust backend functionality and integration with libraries like IOTA.</p>
<p>During the <strong>Build Phase</strong> (see above), the Rust code is compiled into a library that is then incorporated into the Flutter app. The entire codebase is compiled into machine code that can be executed on the target platform. This process ensures that the Rust functionality seamlessly integrates with the Flutter app, allowing for efficient and effective execution on the desired platform.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The backend call _callFfiGetNodeInfo() is mocked, meaning that instead of making a real request to the server, a simulated response is generated. This approach allows us to emulate the behavior of the backend without actually relying on a live server. By mocking the backend call, we can focus on testing and developing the frontend functionality independently, ensuring that the app's features and user interactions are working as intended.</p>

<p>The first step on the Rust side is to include the iota-client library and other necessary resources.</p>
<p>In <em>Cargo.toml</em> add:</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
iota-client = { version = &quot;2.0.1-rc.7&quot;, default-features = false, features = [ &quot;tls&quot; ] }

serde_json = { version = &quot;1.0.89&quot;, default-features = false }
anyhow = &quot;1.0.66&quot;
tokio = { version = &quot;1.21.2&quot;, default-features = false, features = [&quot;macros&quot;] }
</code></pre>
<p>Create the file <em>api.rs</em>. <strong>The file <em>api.rs</em> is YOUR RUST WORKING FILE</strong>. The Flutter-Rust-Bridge code generator will identify all public functions within the <code>api.rs</code> file and generate the corresponding Dart Interface from these methods. This means that all public functions available in the Rust code will be exposed and accessible for utilization within the Flutter app.</p>
<p>By automatically generating the Dart Interface, the Flutter-Rust-Bridge simplifies the process of bridging the communication between the Flutter frontend and the Rust backend, enabling seamless interaction and integration between the two languages.</p>
<p>Add this content to <em>api.rs</em>:</p>
<pre><code>use iota_client::Client;
use anyhow::Result;
use tokio::runtime::Runtime;

pub fn get_node_info() -&gt; Result&lt;String&gt; {
    let rt = Runtime::new().unwrap();
    rt.block_on(async {
        let node_url = &quot;https://api.testnet.shimmer.network&quot;;

        // Create a client with that node.
        let client = Client::builder()
            .with_node(&amp;node_url)?
            .with_ignore_node_health()
            .finish()?;

        // Get node info.
        let info = client.get_info().await?;

        Ok(serde_json::to_string_pretty(&amp;info).unwrap())
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>Replace the content in <em>lib.rs</em> by:</p>
<pre><code>mod api;

<p>This one is easy! It's one of the tasks you need to do whenever the Rust API has changed (e.g. after changing method signatures or add/removing methods). In our example, generate the Dart Interface by executing this command:</p>
<pre><code>flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --rust-input rust/src/api.rs --dart-output ./lib/bridge_generated.dart --dart-decl-output ./lib/bridge_definitions.dart

<p>Next to <em>main.dart</em>, add a new file called <em>ffi.dart</em> and add this content:</p>
<pre><code>// This file initializes the dynamic library and connects it with the stub
// generated by flutter_rust_bridge_codegen.

import 'dart:ffi';

import 'bridge_generated.dart';
import 'bridge_definitions.dart';
export 'bridge_definitions.dart';

// Re-export the bridge so it is only necessary to import this file.
export 'bridge_generated.dart';
import 'dart:io' as io;

const _base = 'rust';

// On MacOS, the dynamic library is not bundled with the binary,
// but rather directly **linked** against the binary.
final _dylib = io.Platform.isWindows ? '$_base.dll' : 'lib$_base.so';

final Rust api = RustImpl(io.Platform.isIOS || io.Platform.isMacOS
    ? DynamicLibrary.executable()
    : DynamicLibrary.open(_dylib));

</code></pre>
<p>Integrating the library involves loading it into our project, enabling us to execute its methods and utilize its functionalities.</p>
<p>Now, in <em>main.dart</em>, comment out line 3:</p>
<pre><code>ffi.dart  // remove the two slashs
</code></pre>
<p>The final step is to insert the appropriate function calls to invoke the desired methods from the library. In <em>main.dart</em>, update the function _callFfiGetNodeInfo().</p>
<p>Replace:</p>
<pre><code>    const receivedText = '{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;HORNET&quot;,&quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0-rc.5&quot;}';
    //final receivedText = await api.getNodeInfo();

<p>During the build process, the Rust code is cross-compiled into a library specific to the target platform (here: arm64-v8a). This compiled library is then automatically copied into the Android project folder.</p>
<p>Then the app is launched.</p>

<p>Exploring the required Targets.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Rust compiler functions as a cross-compiler by default. It allows us to translate our Rust code into the target platform and package it as a library. However, to enable this functionality, we need to ensure that all the required targets are installed on the host computer. In this chapter, we will delve into the relevant targets for <em>IOTA for Flutter</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/targets/index.html" target="_blank">üëâ ¬† Rust Targets</a></p>
<h2 id="about-targets"><a class="header" href="#about-targets">About Targets</a></h2>
<p>In the context of software development, a &quot;target&quot; typically refers to the platform or environment for which software is being developed or compiled. The Components of a target specification can vary depending on the context and tooling being used.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong>: The target architecture specifies the instruction set and hardware architecture for which the software is being compiled or built. Examples include x86, x86_64, ARMv7, ARMv8, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vendor</strong>: The vendor component indicates the company or organization associated with the target platform. It helps identify the specific platform or ecosystem for which the software is intended. Examples include apple, android, linux, windows, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating System</strong>: The operating system component represents the software layer that manages system resources and provides services to applications. It defines the environment in which the software will run. Examples include darwin (macOS, iOS), linux, windows, android, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ABI (Application Binary Interface)</strong>: The ABI component defines the interface between the compiled application code and the operating system and hardware. It defines how functions are called, how parameters and return values are passed, how memory is allocated, and other low-level details of interaction between software and the underlying system.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Unifying Flutter and Rust: Harnessing the power of two technologies.</p>
<hr />
<p>On one hand, we have Flutter, a powerful framework for building user interfaces and applications. On the other hand, we have Rust, a high-performance programming language known for its safety and efficiency. But how can we combine these two technologies?</p>
<p>Enter the Flutter Rust Bridge, a GitHub project designed to address this very challenge of integrating both technologies.</p>

<p>It is important to highlight that, currently, the missing component in this equation is IOTA. However, this tutorial will delve into its integration in the later sections.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="code-generator"><a class="header" href="#code-generator">Code Generator</a></h2>
<p>The Code Generator is a Rust executable that processes Rust code and produces two outputs: a generated module <code>bridge_generated.rs</code> on the Rust side and a Dart file <code>bridge_generated.dart</code> with definitions and implementations on the Dart side. The two files act as a bridge between the two programming languages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Code Generator offers a range of options that you can access by using this terminal command:</p>
<p><code>flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --help</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This command provides you with a list of available options and their respective descriptions, allowing you to customize the code generation process according to your specific needs.</p>
<p>In the <a href="overview/flutter-rust-bridge/../how-everything-works-together/workflow.html">Workflow</a> section documenting an <strong>Android</strong> demo, I used these options:</p>
<pre><code>flutter_rust_bridge_codegen \
--rust-input rust/src/api.rs \                      // Source file
--dart-output ./lib/bridge_generated.dart \         // Output in Dart folder
--dart-decl-output ./lib/bridge_definitions.dart    // Seperate definition file in Dart folder
</code></pre>
<p>When working on code for <strong>iOS</strong>, you will require the following options for the Code Generator:</p>
<pre><code>flutter_rust_bridge_codegen \
--rust-input rust/src/api.rs \                      // Source file
--dart-output ./lib/bridge_generated.dart \         // Output in Dart folder
--dart-decl-output ./lib/bridge_definitions.dart \  // Seperate definition file in Dart folder
--c-output ios/Runner/bridge_generated.h            // Generate a C header in the correct iOS folder
</code></pre>
<p>Similar for <strong>macOS</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>flutter_rust_bridge_codegen \
--rust-input rust/src/api.rs \                      // Source file
--dart-output ./lib/bridge_generated.dart \         // Output in Dart folder
--dart-decl-output ./lib/bridge_definitions.dart \  // Seperate definition file in Dart folder
--c-output macos/Runner/bridge_generated.h          // Generate a C header in the correct macOS folder
</code></pre>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A task for you</strong></p>
<p>For other target platforms such as Browser, Linux, and Windows, please refer to the User Guide for specific instructions on using the Code Generator. Additionally, you have the option to create a YAML config file and utilize the command <code>flutter_run_bridge_codegen [CONFIG_FILE]</code> to streamline the code generation process. I encourage you to give it a try and explore the flexibility and convenience it offers.</p>

<p>Bridging the gap: The power of <em>Flutter Rust Bridge</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The <em>Flutter Rust Bridge</em> serves as the foundation for the &quot;IOTA for Flutter&quot; project. I was glad to have found this solution for the glueing task, with extensive documentation. There may be other alternatives out there, but I didn't look further because the <em>Flutter Rust Bridge</em> met my needs. The scope and features are so vast that I haven't even explored them all myself.</p>
<h3 id="-19"><a class="header" href="#-19"></a></h3>
<figure style="margin:0;"><img src="overview/flutter-rust-bridge/../../assets/frb.png" alt=""><figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em;text-align:center;"><p>User Guide of the Flutter Rust Bridge</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the selection criteria was the project's open-source nature and the fact that it is an active project. From my impression, regular updates ensure that the <em>Flutter Rust Bridge</em> stays up to date.</p>
<p>Additionally, it was important to me that I found support when I had questions. I received friendly and helpful answers, which was reassuring. It's great to know that there are dedicated individuals willing to help and facilitate the development process.</p>
<p>For developers embarking on the <em>IOTA for Flutter</em> journey, the GitHub page of the <em>Flutter Rust Bridge</em> is a valuable resource. Whether you have questions or can support others with your knowledge, it's a place to turn to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How does <em>IOTA for Flutter</em> differ from <em>Flutter Rust Bridge</em>?</strong></p>
<p>While the workflow of <em>IOTA for Flutter</em> utilizes the <em>Flutter Rust Bridge</em> as its foundation, it offers distinct advantages through its context-specific content centered around Shimmer and IOTA. The focus of <em>IOTA for Flutter</em> is to enhance the application and installation process, which has sometimes proven to be challenging. By addressing these difficulties, <em>IOTA for Flutter</em> aims to provide a smoother and more user-friendly experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What further convinced me is the power of the project itself: the <em>Flutter Rust Bridge</em> is packed with features! It's like a treasure chest waiting to be explored. I haven't discovered all its possibilities yet, and that's something for you to explore as well.</p>
<p>For example, <em>IOTA for Flutter</em> has not yet utilized the capability to create multiple API files, to run Flutter Unit tests or the integration of the command runner just, which could potentially optimize the workflow, among other things.</p>
<p>All in all, the <em>Flutter Rust Bridge</em> has become the indispensable tool for this project. I'm grateful to have found a solution that perfectly fits our needs and simplifies the development process.</p>

<h3 id="launch-the-app-in-different-ways"><a class="header" href="#launch-the-app-in-different-ways">Launch the App in different ways</a></h3>
<p>Once Visual Studio Code is open you can launch the app in different ways.</p>
<p>a) By using <code>flutter run</code> command:</p>
<p>Open the Terminal in VS Code (see Shortcut below) and type in <code>flutter run</code>. If there are several targets, the execution is paused and you need to select the target:</p>
