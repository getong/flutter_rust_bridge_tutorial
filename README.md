# ðŸ‘‹ About: IOTA for Flutter

## Hey there!&#x20;

Ready to add some sparkle to your app development? Stay here, where we not only support the IOTA Mainnet but also the Shimmer Network! With this flexible approach, developers can easily choose whether to integrate the Chrysalis or the Stardust version into their projects (and let's be honest, who doesn't love a little shimmer in their code)? So why wait? Say hello to Flutter and Rust and join me on this exciting journey and let us make your apps shine!

{% hint style="info" %}
In fact, the presented workflow supports both the _Shimmer Network_ (protocol version "Stardust") and the _IOTA Mainnet_ (protocol version "Chrysalis"). It depends on which library versions you as developer include in your project.&#x20;

I assume developers are more interested in adopting the Stardust version, so I use the Shimmer (Testnet) and related libraries in my examples.&#x20;

## Background

Originally I was searching for a workflow to build real-world products in the form of mobile and desktop applications backed by the Distributed Ledger Technology of IOTA. My goal was and is to facilitate the adoption of IOTA.

{% hint style="info" %}
Just to clarify, every time I mention _IOTA_, I'm also referring to _Shimmer_.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

I wanted to create a flexible solution that would allow developers to use a reduced technology stack for their projects. With _IOTA for Flutter_, I believe we've achieved that goal, and I'm excited to share it with the world. And believe me: Coming from Java and JavaScript frameworks I was not at all familiar with Flutter and Rust in the beginning.

I remember those days - the endless hours of debugging, the frustration of hitting the same roadblocks over and over again. But after four long months of trial and error, I finally found the solution with _IOTA for Flutter_.&#x20;

This documentation is a condensed tutorial that summarizes everything I learned during that grueling proof-of-concept process. And now, I want to share that knowledge with you. Think of my tutorial as your personal guide to app development for IOTA - a way to save you time and headaches, so you can focus on what really matters.

Now, before you get too excited, I should warn you that app development is still app development, and there's always a chance that things might not work out the way you planned. Trust me, I've been there. But hey, that's half the fun, right? The thrill of the chase, the excitement of finally figuring out that pesky bug - it's all part of the process. Just don't blame me if you find yourself cursing my name at three in the morning when something doesn't work quite right. But hey, if it was easy, everyone would be doing it, right? So let's roll up our sleeves and get to work!

_IOTA for Flutter_ is a sponsored project by the Tangle Community Treasury. The funding allows me to organize my collected notes and prepare them for you. At this point, a big thank you to everyone involved!

## You know Flutter but not IOTA?

If you're a Flutter developer who's not familiar with IOTA or Shimmer, don't worry!

Of course, it's a good idea to take a look at the official websites for IOTA and Shimmer, see below. There, you'll find plenty of resources and information to help you get up to speed on the basics of Distributed Ledger Technology and what it is used for.

But, there's no substitute for hands-on experience, and that's where _IOTA for Flutter_ comes in. While the official websites for IOTA and Shimmer provide a great starting point, the best way to truly understand how to use these technologies in your Flutter projects is to give it a try yourself.&#x20;

_IOTA for Flutter_ provides a tutorial-style documentation that walks you through the process of integrating IOTA and Shimmer step-by-step. So don't be afraid to jump in and give it a shot! Who knows, you might just surprise yourself with what you can accomplish.
